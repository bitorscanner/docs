# Development Guide

This guide will help you set up Bitor for development and explain how to contribute to the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin development, ensure you have these tools installed:

- Go 1.21 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- pnpm 8 or later
- Python 3.10 or later
- Ansible
- Terraform

## Development Environment Setup

First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitorscanner/bitor
cd bitor
```

### Backend Setup

The backend consists of a Go API server and Python automation scripts:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend in development mode
go run main.go serve
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8090`

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is built with SvelteKit and needs to be run separately during development:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

The frontend development server will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```env
PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:8090
ORBIT_API_KEY=12345678901234567890123456789012
```

### Backend Environment Variables

The backend uses the following environment variables:
```env
ORBIT_API_KEY=12345678901234567890123456789012
ORBIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug  # Optional, defaults to info
```

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reloading

The development environment supports various levels of hot reloading:

- **Frontend**: Changes automatically reload in the browser
- **Backend Go**: Requires manual restart
- **Backend Python**: Files automatically reload

### Code Structure

```
bitor/
├── frontend/           # SvelteKit frontend application
│   ├── src/           # Frontend source code
│   └── static/        # Static assets
├── backend/           # Go backend application
│   ├── api/          # API endpoints
│   ├── core/         # Core business logic
│   └── scripts/      # Python automation scripts
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

### Building for Production

When you need to build for production:

```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
pnpm build

# Build backend
cd ../backend
go build
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Frontend tests
cd frontend
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e  # Run end-to-end tests

# Backend tests
cd backend
go test ./...
```

### Writing Tests

- Frontend tests use Vitest and Playwright
- Backend tests use Go's testing package
- Include tests with all new features
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting PRs

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Write or update tests
5. Submit a pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Follow existing code style
- Include relevant tests
- Update documentation
- Provide clear PR description

## Troubleshooting

Common development issues and solutions:

### Frontend Issues

- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall if dependencies act up
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

### Backend Issues

- Ensure Python virtual environment is activated
- Check Go version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are installed
